## Name

Stage-based processing pipeline

## Type

requirement

## Status

approved

## Description

Dumptruck must process inputs via a stage-based pipeline that is explicit, composable, and operationally auditable. The pipeline definition consolidates the 15-stage detailed sequence into the higher-level 8-stage logical map, without losing the safety and forensic steps (evidence, chain of custody, secure deletion).
