## Documentation

The first place to look for answers is our:

- [Official Documentation](docs/) — Comprehensive guides and architecture

- [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/) — Design decisions and system structure

## I Have a Question

Before asking a question:

1. Review the [documentation](docs/) to see if your question is answered
2. Check the [FAQ section](docs/EXAMPLES.md) for common usage patterns
3. Review [CLI_USAGE.md](docs/CLI_USAGE.md) for command examples

If you still need help:

1. Create a detailed issue describing your question
2. Use a descriptive title
3. Provide as much context as possible:
   + Version you're using (run `dumptruck --version` or check `Cargo.toml`)
   + Environment details (OS, Rust version, etc.)
   + Steps to reproduce
   + Relevant logs or error messages
   + Example data that demonstrates the issue
